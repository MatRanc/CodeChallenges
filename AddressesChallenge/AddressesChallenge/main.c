     For a signed short, the smallest number is -32768 (2^15) and the largest is 32767 (2^15 -1)
     As the sign takes up one space it is 15 rather than 16
     
     But for an unsigned short, it can hold up to 65553 (2^16 -1) as there is no need for a sign, they are only positive.
   
     
     Why minus one?
     
     Because the counting starts from 0
     And the range of int is 2,147,483,647 and 2^32 which is 2,147,483,648. hence we subtract 1
     Also the loss of 1 bit is for the positive and negative sign
