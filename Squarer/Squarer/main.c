    The \ is the escape characer, which tells the output (/compiler) that whats before this does not have its normal meaning. So, \" indicates that the quotation does not follow the ususal printf guidelines. Closing the string with \" again tells that its not the normal meaning as there is still a newline break at the end.
 
        TLDR = When wanting quoatations for a specific part, do: \"DATA\"
